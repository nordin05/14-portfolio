                    Hi I'm <span class="name">Nordin</span>. This is my

                        I got my Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering but during
                        my studies I discovered that I enjoy programming more.
                        Now Iâ€™m learning Web Development through self-study with
                        the help of The Odin Project. I immediately loved Web
                        Dev from the moment I started, the reason is because I
                        love being creative but also love problem solving, and
                        this is the perfect mix of both.

                    <p>
                        One of my biggest passions is 2D Animation and Drawing,
                        I love visual art and everything that moves. I spend a
                        lot of my time working on 2D animations, drawing each
                        frame by hand. I also do a lot of 2D compositing in
                        After Effects, in order to add effects and camera motion
                        to animations. Because of these skills I have developed
                        a good sense of timing when it comes to animating with
                        keyframes
